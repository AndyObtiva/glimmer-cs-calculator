# TODO

These are some feature suggestions:

- Make backspace button delete numbers one by one instead of all at the same time
- Make delete button delete all numbers just like escape
- Support copy/paste of result
- Add an Edit menu with Copy/Cut/Paste
- Support CMD+C and CMD+X and CMD+V shortcuts for copy, cut, and paste
- Webify with Glimmer DSL for Opal in a Rails application
- Host Glimmer DSL for Opal Rails application on Heroku
- Support operator precedences like doing 1 + 9 * 8 (expected: 73 since * takes precedence over +)
